In this exciting game, players step into the shoes of a notorious criminal who is on the run, desperately escaping the blinding light of a pursuing helicopter in a sprawling, darkened city.

## About the Game

The main objective is to survive for as long as possible while evading capture. Players assume the role of a fugitive who can skillfully leap across buildings and navigate obstacles.
